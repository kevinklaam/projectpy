# Intro

A python program that uses pandas, numpy, matplotlib to plot the daily stock movements of a particular ticker.
Added a GUI with PyQT5 library

Outputs current ticker information to a csv file and matplots the information onto a plot.

This is was a second year project I made because I was interested in learning to build something using Python and also to pull data from API's then manipulate the data
